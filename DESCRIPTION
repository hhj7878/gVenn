Description: Tools to compute and visualize overlaps between gene sets or 
    genomic regions. Venn diagrams with proportional areas are provided,
    while UpSet plots are recommended for larger numbers of sets. The package
    supports GRanges and GRangesList inputs, and integrates with analysis
    workflows for ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and other genomic interval data.
    It generates clean, interpretable, and publication-ready figures.
